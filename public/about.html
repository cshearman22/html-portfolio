<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Corinna Shearman, I have been a flight attendant for the past 8 years. 
  Now I am lucky enough to be taking Angela Yu's Web Development self-paced Bootcamp on Udemy.
</p>

<p>I started the course one week ago with no knowledge whatsoever about coding or web development
  and so far I have learnt a lot about HTML. I look forward to learning CSS next 
  and then advancing into JavaScript.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out my portfolio which displays my very first few projects, as I progress in this 
  course my porfolio will be updated.</p>
